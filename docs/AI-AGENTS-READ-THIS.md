# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: AI Agents Read This First

## Archive Policy

**DO NOT read files in the `archive/` folder unless the user explicitly asks you to.**

The `archive/` folder contains completed work that is no longer actively being developed. Reading these files wastes tokens and provides outdated context.

### What's in the Archive
- Completed user stories
- Historical feature documentation
- Old implementation details

### When to Read Archive Files
**ONLY** when the user specifically says:
- "Read the archived story..."
- "Check the archive for..."
- "Look at the completed story..."

### Where to Find Current Information

**For active development:**
- `docs/README.md` - Current features and active stories
- `docs/stories/README.md` - Active stories only
- `docs/features/` - Current feature documentation

**For code understanding:**
- `riz_erp/riz_erp/report/project_overview/` - Current implementation
- All code files have function comments explaining what each function does

## .aiignore File

The `docs/.aiignore` file lists folders to ignore. Respect this file to reduce token usage.

---

**Summary:** Focus on current documentation, ignore archive unless explicitly told otherwise.
